   * When running in a graphical execution environment a step can make one or

   * additional graphical views. The map returned by this method should be keyed
   * by action name (e.g. "View results"), and values should be fully qualified
   * names of the corresponding StepInteractiveView implementation. Furthermore,
   * the contents of this map can (and should) be dependent on whether a
   * particular viewer should be made available - i.e. if execution hasn't
   * occurred yet, or if a particular incoming connection type is not present,
   * then it might not be possible to view certain results.
   *
   * Viewers can implement StepInteractiveView directly (in which case they need
   * to extends JPanel), or extends the AbstractInteractiveViewer class. The
   * later extends JPanel, uses a BorderLayout, provides a "Close" button and a
   * method to add additional buttons.
